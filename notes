Here's where I stand:

Take an initial serial pass on the set of available moves.  Number them 1 to numthreads (1 2 3 1 2 3 ...).  Then each processor runs serial AB on its subset.  Then you merge results.

I think I can get rid of bTo and bFrom with negligible impact
I need to move some of the unique Reset characteristics up front.

What to keep and what to omit from the tree:
- I still don't know if ABSaveBest is worth keeping.
- I should track the number of times a node has been considered in my AB routine.  If it has not been considered more than once, I should prune all of its children at some point.


PGN:
chess.com offers a bunch of huge PGN files.  If I can devise a way to read and analyze the multiple games therein, I will have some insight into how to optimally order some performance path routines.

ponder:
If ponder is off, I need to generate the first ply of moves for checking.
Also, quit needs to be fixed when ponder is off

xboard integration works to some extent.  The following is missing:
- Pawn promotion does not work for either computer or opponent
- Limited command support.  Need to read the doc more thoroughly and figure out where the gaps are
  - Probably need a file output from chessica to document xboard-engine talks

I want to improve my A-B pruning:
- Past ply 5 (or maybe 4) keep only the best move.
  - This means CurrentNode in these cases will have to be initialized for new move generation after each iteration
  - It will also have to (probably) ignore duplicate moves with this new generation

Engine still needs:
- To understand the 3 board positions rule
- 50 move rule implemented but not tested (FEN needs to understand this)


Spawn a thread to handle chess thinking.  Then the main thread will handle I/O.
- Create an I/O lock.  You must hold the lock to speak to xboard.
